                    I love to mix great visuals with good technology, I've always believed that art and tech works great hand to hand. I've always loved multiple aspects of technologies and art, making music, graphic design, game development, 3D modeling or animations. I'm always trying to improve and add new technologies to my toolbox, this way I have more to offer, and I can create great websites.
